SmartEverything ST HTS221  Humidity Sensor
=============================================================

This is a library for the ST HTS221 component.

The HTS221 is an ultra compact sensor for relative humidity and temperature.
It includes a sensing element and a mixed signal ASIC to provide the measurement information
through digital serial interfaces.

The sensing element consists of a polymer dielectric planar capacitor structure
capable of detecting relative humidity variations and is manufactured using a dedicated ST process.

The HTS221 is available in a small top-holed cap land grid array (HLGA)
package guaranteed to operate over a temperature range from -40 °C to +120 °C.

Host control and result reading is performed using an I2C interface, no extra pins are required.

It was principally designed to work with the SmartEverything board, but could
be easily adapt and use on every Arduino and Arduino Certified boards.
