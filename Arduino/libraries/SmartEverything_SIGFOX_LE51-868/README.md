SmartEverything Telit LE51-868  Sigfox complete module
=============================================================
This is a library for the Telit LE51-868 component.
A Short Range to Long Range module designed to cover the 863-870 MHz band
working with the Telit Proprietary protocol and acting as a SIGFOX gateway.

This component use an internal USART to communicate, no extra pin are required.

It was principally designed to work with the SmartEverything board, but could
be easily adapt and use on every Arduino and Arduino Certified boards.

About SIGFOX
===============
In a few words
--------------
**SIGFOX is an operated telecommunication network, dedicated to the Internet of Things.**

It is an operated network, meaning you do not have to handle any installation or maintenance operations.
SIGFOX is seamless and out-of-the box, allowing you to forget about communication and keep focused on the core of your project.

It is a LPWA (Low-Power Wide-Area) network, currently deployed in Western Europe & San Francisco.

The SIGFOX allows a bidirectional communication, both from & to the device.
The communication is always initiated by the device.

The SIGFOX protocol is designed for small messages sent every now and then. It is not appropriate for high-bandwith usages (multimedia, permanent broadcast).

Its focus on energy efficiency allows you to build connected devices able to last years on a standard battery.

Technology
----------
The SIGFOX network operates on sub-GHz frequencies, on ISM bands : 868MHz in Europe/ETSI & 915MHz in the US/FCC.

SIGFOX uses an Ultra-Narrow Band (UNB) modulation, which is key to our ability to provide a scalable & high-capacity network.

With a 162dB path loss SIGFOX enable long range communications, with much longer reach than GSM.

There is no negociation between the device and a receiving station. The device simply emits in the available frequency band (+/- its own frequency shift).
The signal is detected by the closer base stations, decoded & forwarded to the network backend.
Deduplication & other protocol operations are handed by the network itself.
Message is then forwarded to your own application, and accessible using SIGFOX's API. ()

SIGFOX Specifics
--------------
**In a few words**
- Up to 12 bytes per message
- Up to 140 messages per day

**Message size**
You can send up to 12 bytes (96 bits) per message. 
The protocol metadata already include a timestamp & the device unique id.

**Number of messages**
The maximum number of messages that can be sent each day is 140. This limitation is in part here to comply with regulations.
The european regulation on the 868MHz band enforce a transmission duty cycle of 1%. 
A unique device is not allowed to emit more than 1% of the time each hour. 
As emission of a message can take up to ~6 seconds, this allows up to 6 messages per hour
